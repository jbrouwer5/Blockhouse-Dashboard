# Approach and Tradeoffs 

Hi there! This assignment was fun and breif, but I thought I would go through the few decisions I made throughout the process. 

- No real decisions to be made when implementing the backend. Django is a nice framework for this in case I was going to add onto it, such as incorporating a database, authentication, or serialization for more complicated datatypes.
- When choosing a chart library I decided that ChartJS was the most dependable and therefore I went with that for the charts. Additionally I found that ChartJS had a special financials version that contained a Candlestick graph which I knew was going to be important
- I decided I wanted to incorporate React components since they're very clean and easy to work with.
- Additionally, I decided to make my API calls with Axios over fetch since it has a few extra features I appreciate.
- I thought typescript would be important not only because it was a bonus requirement, but because type safety makes development much easier once you're avoiding type related bugs.
- Lastly I used Redux for state management.
- I decided to add a toggle between light mode and dark mode since I find dark mode more pleasant but the charts were slightly easier to read with light colors.


I wrote README files in both the frontend and backend directory that explain how to run the servers locally manually and with Docker. 


Thank you for taking the time to look through this project! I'm excited to continue learning about Blockhouse! Feel free to email me at jbrouwer08@gmail.com with any questions or comments.
